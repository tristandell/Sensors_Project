# Sensors Project

A project aiming to use Arduino and Raspberry Pi devices to measure key parameters within buildings to assess their environmental performance. 

Many aspects of this project build on solutions developed by www.openenergymonitor.org.
All code written or adapted by tristandell.


# Temperature and Humidity Node
Based on the emonTH unit developed by www.openenergymonitor.org, this code is designed to take measurements of temperature and humidity, using an Arduino to report values back via the serial monitor. 

*RF Communications*
Radiofrequency data transmission capabilities are not included in this addition, but may be added later in order to facilitate communication with a data logger.
